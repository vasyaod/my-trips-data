title: To The East Coast
description: Day 4. Nevada. Tent. Welcome To Nevada. High altitude, good state of roads,  and wind blowing to my back allowed me to reach a good average speed and  to ride more then 200 km. A huge advantage of Nevada is that the tent could be set up everywhere, all lands are not private (almost)
